# FB-Message-Reader
A java program designed to take input from the messages.htm (found when you download a copy of your fb profile)  file and output it in a more human readable manner.

Why a new program when other options exists? 
Well the only two other options I've found are python based and using the beautiful soup library, whilst this does have many advantages with being more general, it had two main problems in my experience.

Firstly it involved setting up python and downloading multiple requiste libraries to get them running, not too hard sure but it certainly takes away from ease of use for someone who just wants to look at their past fb messages easily.

Secondly and more to the point these both (I assume) try to parse the whole document as an html file, which in my case (a 65mb file) results in the program eating up memory before it eventually fails.

Contrasting that with mine it can finish before the alternatives have had the chance even eat up a gigabyte of RAM!
