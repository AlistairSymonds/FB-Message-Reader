  "body": "### Getting started (and finished!) guide\r\nSo you just want to read your fb messages easily? Well you've come to the right place, firstly you'll need the following:\r\n* Your messages.htm file (found in your profile download .zip from facebook)\r\n* The FB-Message-Reader.jar file to run the program\r\n\r\n1. Put these two files in the same directory \r\nimage\r\n2. Open a terminal/cmd window in same directory (on windows: shift right click, then select \"Open command window here\") and type in the following command 'java -jar FB-Message-Reader.jar'\r\nimage\r\n3. Sit back watch the magic happen, hopefully now you will see all the text files the program is creating fly past on the screen before finishing telling you how long it took and how many message threads it read. (Note: Facebook creates a new thread every 10000 messages, this is why you may have multiple threads with the same person/people)\r\nimage\r\n\r\n##Making sense of the results\r\nEach file name takes one of three formats:\r\n1. EMPTY THREAD - Simply a message thread which didn't contain any messages\r\n2. _first name last name_ - A two person conversation, just listing the other person's name\r\n3. Group _multiple initials_ - A group conversation, instead of listing full names it just lists initials in the file name to avoid ridiculously long names\r\n\r\nAt the end of each file is a number which is simply where the thread was in the original messages.htm file\r\n\r\nFor non-empty message threads it also lists the date of the last message in that thread.\r\nimages\r\n",
  "note": "Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."
